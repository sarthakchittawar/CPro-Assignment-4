# Computer Programming - Assignment 4 
#### Roll No.: 2021111010

# ~
Collection of all files (.c as well as .pdf) required for the assignment submission.

### Instructions to compile and run (all done on Ubuntu 20.04)
If the program doesn't require files:
```
$ gcc code.c
$ ./a.out
```
If the program requires files:
```
$ gcc code.c
$ ./a.out <file1> <file2> ... <file(n)>
```

The input files should be stored in the same directory as the executable files, while running/compiling.
The output(s) of the programs will either be printed on terminal after execution, or stored as a file in the same directory. (depending on the question)

* Some codes (Eg: [Q5 Encrypt/Decrypt](./S3)) may take long time for execution for large data inputs, but they do work properly.


### Shortcut links:
1. [Randomness in Computation](./S1)
2. [Streaming Computations](./S2)
3. [Cryptography and Bit Manipulation](./S3)
4. [Data on the Disk](./S4)
